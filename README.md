# Artificial-Intelligence
AI Project: Nearest Neighbor, using leaving-one-out validation and forward selection feature search

Some possible features to be added:
1) Have the user enter their PWD and have the program read it and pass it to a function to read data from the location entered by user
2) Have the program iterate until the user chooses to stop
3) Implement a more efficient search algorithm
4) Implement Backward Elimination feature search
5) Have the user enter which properties they want to use:
    ie. Choose between Forward Selection or Backward Elimination
        Different validation algorithms: Leave-one-out ---> currently implemented
                                         K-fold validation

This project was created for my CS170: Aritficial Intelligence Class
